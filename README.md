# Java JSON to CSV Converter Project

This repository contains the deliverables for the Sprint 2 of the Back End in Java for Information Processing project. The primary goal of this stage was to develop a desktop Java program capable of reading data from a JSON file and converting it into a structured CSV file. This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming practices, including dependency management with Maven, file I/O operations, JSON parsing, CSV writing, and proper code documentation.

## Challenge Instructions Fulfillment

This project meticulously addresses each instruction outlined for Sprint 2:

1.  **Implement in Java: Use a popular library for JSON manipulation in Java.**
    * **Fulfillment:** The project is entirely implemented in Java. For JSON manipulation, the widely used **Jackson Databind** library (`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`) has been integrated via Maven. This library provides robust and efficient functionalities for serializing and deserializing Java objects to and from JSON.

2.  **Create a Java class with a function to read JSON files. This function must: open the JSON file, parse the contents into an appropriate data structure, and handle possible exceptions.**
    * **Fulfillment:** The `BookJsonReader.java` class (`src/main/java/com/luisdavid/file/json/BookJsonReader.java`) is dedicated to reading JSON files.
        * It contains the `readBooksFromJson(String filePath)` method, which takes a file path as input.
        * It opens the JSON file using Java's `File` and Jackson's `ObjectMapper`.
        * It parses the contents into a `List<Book>` data structure, where `Book.java` acts as a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) representing the JSON structure.
        * Robust exception handling is implemented using a `try-catch` block to manage `IOException` (for file not found or reading errors) that might occur during file operations.

3.  **Write CSV files: Use a library to write CSV files in Java.**
    * **Fulfillment:** The **OpenCSV** library (`com.opencsv:opencsv`) is utilized for all CSV writing operations. This library simplifies the process of generating well-formatted CSV files, including handling delimiters and various cell formats.

4.  **Create a Java class with a function to write data to a CSV file. This function must: create and write data into a CSV file, configure delimiters and cell formats as needed, and handle possible exceptions.**
    * **Fulfillment:** The `WriteDataToCsv.java` class (`src/main/java/com/luisdavid/file/csv/WriteDataToCsv.java`) is responsible for writing data to CSV files.
        * It features the `writeBooksToCsv(List<Book> books, String filePath)` method.
        * This function creates a new CSV file at the specified `filePath`.
        * It configures the initial row as a header and then iterates through a list of `Book` objects to write each book's data as a row in the CSV. The `CSVWriter` from OpenCSV automatically handles delimiters (commas by default) and quoting for cell formats.
        * `IOException` is caught and handled to manage potential write errors.

5.  **Document using JavaDoc: Include JavaDoc comments in each function and class to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values.**
    * **Fulfillment:** Comprehensive JavaDoc comments have been added to all relevant classes (`Main.java`, `Book.java`, `BookJsonReader.java`, `WriteDataToCsv.java`) and their public methods. These comments clearly describe the purpose of each component, its parameters (`@param`), and its return values (`@return`), ensuring clear and useful documentation.

6.  **GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository, include a README.md, all files, and proper access permissions.**
    * **Fulfillment:** This `README.md` file serves as the project description. All code files, `pom.xml`, and resource files are organized in a structured manner within this repository. Access permissions are configured for review. The `README.md` also details the steps required to review and run the repository content.

## Key Learning Points from this Challenge

Throughout this challenge, significant experience was gained in several key areas:

* **Modular Programming in Java:** Understanding the importance of separating concerns into distinct classes (e.g., `BookJsonReader` for reading, `WriteDataToCsv` for writing, and `Main` for orchestration) to promote code reusability, maintainability, and readability.
* **Maven for Dependency Management:** Learning how to effectively use `pom.xml` to declare and manage external libraries like Jackson and OpenCSV, ensuring project builds are consistent and dependencies are correctly resolved.
* **JSON Parsing:** Gaining practical experience with a popular JSON library (Jackson Databind) to deserialize JSON arrays into Java objects, handling complex data structures within JSON.
* **CSV Writing:** Implementing file writing operations to produce structured CSV output from parsed data, utilizing the OpenCSV library for simplified CSV formatting.
* **Exception Handling:** Applying `try-catch` blocks for robust error management in file I/O operations, making the application more resilient to common issues like file not found or corrupted data.
* **JavaDoc Documentation:** Practicing the creation of professional-grade documentation directly within the source code, enhancing clarity and future maintainability.
* **Git Version Control:** Reinforcing best practices in Git, including staging changes, crafting meaningful commit messages, and understanding how to manage repository history.

Upon successful execution of the `Main.java` class:

* **Console Output:**
    You will observe messages in your console indicating the progress of the conversion process, such as:
    ```
    --- Initiating JSON to CSV conversion ---
    3 books read successfully.
    CSV created successfully in: libros_output.csv
    --- Process completed ---
    ```

* **File Output:**
    A new file named `libros_output.csv` will be created in the **root directory of your project** (the same folder where your `pom.xml` and `README.md` files reside). This CSV file will contain the book data parsed from `books.json`, structured with a header row and each book's details in a separate row.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following external libraries, managed by Maven:

* **Jackson Databind**: `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` (Version 2.13.3)
    * Used for reading and parsing JSON files, mapping JSON data to Java objects.
* **OpenCSV**: `com.opencsv:opencsv` (Version 5.9)
    * Used for writing data to CSV files, handling CSV formatting and output.
